## Assignment Operator
Without running the following code, try to determine:

```js
let a = 1;
let b = 'bongos';
let c = true;

a = b;
b = c;
c = a;
```

### Your solution here:
1.  What is `a`?
```
a is 'bongos'
```
2.  What is `b`?
```
b is True
```
3.  What is `c`?
```
c is 'bongos'
```

## Concatenation
Use the `+` operator to concatenate these strings together within a `console.log()`: "Please", "squeeze", "the", "cheese". Make sure there are spaces in-between each word.

```js
const firstWord = "Please";
const secondWord = "squeeze";
const thirdWord = "the";
const fourthWord = "cheese";
```
Result should be:
```js
"Please squeeze the cheese"
```

### Your solution here:
4.  Fill in the `console.log()`?
```js
console.log(firstWord + " " + secondWord + " " + thirdWord + " " + fourthWord)
```

Output a console log `The sum of 5 and 10 is 15` where the values for 5 and 10 are saved to variables, and where 15 comes from those variables being summed.
```js
const num1 = 5;
const num2 = 10;
```

### Your solution here:
5.  How can we make `num3` equal to the sum of `num1` and `num2`?
```js
let num3 = num1 + num2
// your solution here
```
6.  Use variables `num1`, `num2` and `num3` to fill in the `console.log()` to complete the sentence: 

>The sum of 5 and 10 is 15

```js
console.log("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + num3)
```

## Comparisons
By just looking at the following expressions, determine in your mind whether or not each will evaluate to true or false
```
a) 999 > 999
b) 999 === 999 
c) 999 !== 999
d) -5 >= -4
e) 100 <= -100
f) 20 + 5 < 5 
g) 81 / 9 === 9
h) 9 !== 8 + 1
```
### Your solution here:
7.  Write `true` or `false` based on the list above
```
a) false
b) true
c) false
d) false
e) false
f) false
g) true
h) false
```

## Conditionals
Declare a variable equal to a number 0 to 100

Write a conditional statement that...
- If it is a multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number.
- If it is a multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number.
- If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.
- Otherwise, print the number

### Your solution here:
8.  Write your javascript solution below
```js
let num = 90;
if ( num % 3 === 0 && num % 5 ===0 ) {
     console.log('FizzBuzz')
} else if ( num % 3 === 0 ) {
     console.log('Fizz')
} else if ( num % 5 === 0 ) {
     console.log('Buzz')
} else {
    console.log(num)
}
// your answer here
```

#### BONUS
9.  Research a [loop](https://javascript.info/while-for) so that your condition runs on every number from 0 to 100
```js
// your answer here
```
10.  Research a [function](https://javascript.info/function-basics) so that your condition runs on every number from 0 to whatever number is passed into the function
```js
// your answer here
```
